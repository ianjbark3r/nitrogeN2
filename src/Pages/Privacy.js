          <p>
            NitrogeN2 Limited Liability Corporation takes precautions to protect your information.

            This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is <u>not</u> directed at children under the age of 13 and does <u>not</u> knowingly collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site.
